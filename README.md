This code is for the paper **COVID-Net Biochem: An Explainability-driven Framework
to Building Machine Learning Models for Predicting
Survival and Kidney Injury of COVID-19 Patients from
Clinical and Biochemistry Data**

This code is for doing survival prediction and Acute Kidney Injury prediction of COVID-19 patients. For survival prediction, use ```main```  branch. For Acute Kidney Injury predictio, use ```hossein/kidney```  branch.

The main file for doing prediction is ```main.py```.
```main.py``` has argparser where you can set the model for prediction, change learning rate, select test size and other configs.

Currently we support the following models:
