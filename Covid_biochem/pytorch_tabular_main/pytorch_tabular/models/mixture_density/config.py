            By default is a uniform distribution across the features. Choices are: ['uniform', 'normal']

            Used in the Data-aware initialization of thresholds where the threshold is initialized randomly
            (with a beta distribution) to feature values in the first batch.
            It initializes threshold to a q-th quantile of data points.
            where q ~ Beta(:threshold_init_beta:, :threshold_init_beta:)
            If this param is set to 1, initial thresholds will have the same distribution as data points
            If greater than 1 (e.g. 10), thresholds will be closer to median data value
            If less than 1 (e.g. 0.1), thresholds will approach min/max data values.
        threshold_init_cutoff (float):
            Used in the Data-aware initialization of scales(used in the scaling ODTs).
            It is initialized in such a way that all the samples in the first batch belong to the linear
            region of the entmoid/sparsemoid(bin-selectors) and thereby have non-zero gradients
            Threshold log-temperatures initializer, in (0, inf)
            By default(1.0), log-temperatures are initialized in such a way that all bin selectors
            end up in the linear region of sparse-sigmoid. The temperatures are then scaled by this parameter.
            Setting this value > 1.0 will result in some margin between data points and sparse-sigmoid cutoff value
            Setting this value < 1.0 will cause (1 - value) part of data points to end up in flat sparse-sigmoid region
            For instance, threshold_init_cutoff = 0.9 will set 10% points equal to 0.0 or 1.0
            Setting this value > 1.0 will result in a margin between data points and sparse-sigmoid cutoff value
            All points will be between (0.5 - 0.5 / threshold_init_cutoff) and (0.5 + 0.5 / threshold_init_cutoff)
        embed_categorical (bool): Flag to embed categorical columns using an Embedding Layer.
            If turned off, the categorical columns are encoded using LeaveOneOutEncoder
        embedding_dims (Union[List[int], NoneType]): The dimensions of the embedding for each categorical column as a
            list of tuples (cardinality, embedding_dim). If left empty, will infer using the cardinality of the categorical column
            using the rule min(50, (x + 1) // 2)
